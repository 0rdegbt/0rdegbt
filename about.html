                <p>My name is Orde Gilbert Wiguna, I was born on the 17th of October 2003 in Kabupaten Tangerang, Banten, Indonesia. Currently, I'm a second semester Informatics student of Universitas Multimedia Nusantara's 21st generation.</p>
                <p>Aside from studying, there are other things I do, like:</p>

                        <p class="title">I play a lot of video games</p>
                        <p>Video games have been my main source of entertainment since I was little, starting from PSP games, to present day PC/Laptop games. I play various genres of video games, RPG, Strategy, Rougelike, Platformer, even Card Games. The picture on the left are title screens of the video games I play actively nowadays, like Genshin Impact, Skul: The Hero Slayer, Arknights, and Yu-Gi-Oh: Master Duel.</p>

                        <p class="title">Getting into data analysis</p>
                        <p>When I'm not playing video games or doing my assignments, I like collect game statistics, create multiple different scenarios, and see the outcome. Currently, this is limited to video games such as damage calculation. However, I do believe that this would be a handy skill to have later in the future.</p>

                        <p>With over 4 years of experience using Photoshop and other editing softwares, I have grown to love creating, modifying, and editing pictures/videos. So far, I've created mockup movie posters, wallpapers, even original illustrations.</p>

                        <p>Besides creating and editing artworks digitally, I also have experience in painting. Specifically using acrylic paints and watercolor paints. However, I don't do this often as the cost of canvases and the paints themselves can get quite expensive.</p>

                        <p>Another hobby I've recently started enjoying is making plastic model kits. While they can get extremely expensive, I enjoy the process of building and assembling them. On top of that, the end result is also satisfying to look at.</p>
